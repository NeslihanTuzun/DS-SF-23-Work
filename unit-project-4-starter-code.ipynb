The goal is to use GPA, GRE and undergraduate institution to predict admission into graduate school.\n",

Multinomial logistic regression is used to model nominal outcome variables, in which the log odds of the outcomes are modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables.\n"

    "Answer: The dataset has a binary response variable called admit. There are three predictor variables: gre, gpa and prestige. GRE and GPA are continuous variables. The variable prestige takes on the values 1 through 4. Institutions with a prestige of 1 have the highest prestige, while those with a rank of 1 have the lowest. Create dummy variables for prestige that has four levels: 1, 2, 3 and 4 (1 being most prestigious). New dataframe will get a dataframe with four columns, each of which describes one of those levels. Once that's done, merging the new dummy columns into the original dataset and get rid of the prestige column which we no longer need."
